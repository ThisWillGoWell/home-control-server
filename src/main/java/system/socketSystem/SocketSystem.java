/**
 * Created by Will on 3/19/2017.
 * Socket Systems allow for a websocket connection to act as a system
 * All Parcels sent to the SocketSystem are converted to JSON String
 * and then sends it
 *
 * The SocketSystem works closeyl with the controlWebsocket.py
 * to establish a connection and syc states
 * The idea is you will be able to do basic get and set,
 * where this guy will then work with controlwebsocket to sync states1
